Questionnaires are essential tools for gathering the necessary information on participants' experiences and impressions. Thus, please avoid the three following mistakes:

1. Length: Too many questions (Also repeating questions between different conditions) may lead to participants losing interest and skipping questions or answering in patterns instead of honestly.
2. Unclear Questions: Avoid open-ended and leading questions.
3. Bias: The individual questions should be formulated neutral to ensure clear, objective answers from the participants.

For setting up the questionnaires rely on standardized questionnaires in your field of research and add your own specific questions to investigate your research objective meaningfully.
