Questionnaires are essential tools for gathering the necessary information on participants' experiences and impressions. Thus, please avoid the three following mistakes:

1. Length: Too many questions (Also repeating questions between different conditions) may lead to participants losing interest and skipping questions or answering in patterns instead of honestly.
2. Unclear Questions: Avoid open-ended and leading questions.
3. Bias: The individual questions should be formulated neutral to ensure clear, objective answers from the participants.

For setting up the questionnaires rely on standardized questionnaires in your field of research and add your own specific questions to investigate your research objective meaningfully.

Below are different examples - in English only - you may use provided as XML files to directly load into SoSciSurvey.

**Demographics**
- [Demographics](uploads/664aa2ac49fa53861bfc0360ac91cf48/package_Demographics.xml) containing gender, age, dominant hand, vision, VR frequency, and VR usage cause - please add your own questions in case you are interested in a specific feature and pre-knowledge of your participants (or as [German version](uploads/3078b1b8e977c5b3ef149b2335ecc0dc/package_Demographics-Deutsch_2023-02-17.xml))

- in case SSQ is too long and simulator sickness is not in focus, we recommend the short [Discomfort Score](uploads/62259e1d9c8819474b6422aaae5cf8a2/package_DiscomfortScore.xml) by [Fernandes et al.](https://www.doi.org/10.1109/3DUI.2016.7460053)

- [Social Presence Inventory for Interactions with Embodied Virtual Agents (SPI-IEVA)](uploads/e8ecbf7fb0a4879ce4383b3d0a09d4b6/package_CombinedSocialPresence.xml) is an inventory based on various standardized questionnaires, using only constructs focussing first on the users own attitudes towards the virtual agents in the scene, followed by questions detailing the experience with the virtual interaction partners. @jonathan.ehret and @Andrea.Boensch are working with it in particular and the questionnaire is still under construction. In case you plan on using it, contact both first and make sure to replace the current "pedestrians" team with an appropriate term for your specific use case.
