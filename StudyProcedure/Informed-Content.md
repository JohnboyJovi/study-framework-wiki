Here is our default [InformedConsent.docx](uploads/9c89c05f8e3f8bedb084da1d96ec77fa/InformedConsent.docx). 

Please adapt it to your study by inserting your name (and your supervisor's name and mail address in case you are doing your final thesis with us). Specify the system to be used as well as the approximate duration of the study.
Finally, state where/how the questionnaire data will be collected and stored and if any additional tests will be run except the questionnaires.

Take care each and every participant signs it. Keep the signed forms (and hand them over to your supervisor at the end of the study). We recommend scanning them and adding them to an appropriate git repo.
