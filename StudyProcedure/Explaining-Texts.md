In case you are using SoSciSurvey or another solution for online questionnaires you may include the introductory text or the task descriptions in there. However, we recommend having them on individual sheets of paper so participants can reread important parts throughout the study if required.

Please find attached a [template](uploads/e1016381a14d3df4d4767449a55cbd38/StudyDescription.docx) for our introductory text and/or task description. Fill it with all the content participants need to know prior to starting the study either directly with a condition or with a familiarization phase to get comfortable and learn the controls or the task.
