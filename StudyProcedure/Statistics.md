Here are some hints and ideas how to evaluate the gathered data.

# Software

One possibility is to use RStudio. (Install r: https://cran.rstudio.com/, and then install RStudio: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

All of the scripts below are for RStudio, but for example also ðŸ”´*add the program used by Sevince*ðŸ”´ can be used.

# Demographics

If you gathered demogrpahic data, e.g., with SoSciSurvey, you should report who participated, by giving their number ``n=...`` participants, their gender count and at least age with mean (M) and standard deviation (SD)
