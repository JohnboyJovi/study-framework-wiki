# What is logged and where:

* In ``StudyFramework/StudyRuns/LastParticipant.txt`` always the last participant that the study was executed and some information on that run is stored.
* In ``StudyFramework/StudyRuns/Participant_[i].txt`` The conditions planned/executed for participant i are stored as json.
* In ``StudyFramework/Results/LogParticipant_[i]`` comments (with a preceeding '#'), events (Start condition..) and reported dependent variable values are logged
* In ``StudyFramework/Results/Phase_[...].csv`` holds for each phase the data of all participants. This is in a format to easily use in statistics tool like ``r``.
* In ``StudyFramework/Logs/SFLog.txt`` all logs generated by the study framework are gathered (mainly for debugging).
