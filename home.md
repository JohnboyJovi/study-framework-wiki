* Have similar data for different data (facilitating meta analyses and sharing analysis tools)
* Do **not** overengineer

For information on how to use this, go to the [HowToUse-Section](HowToUse)

[What is logged and where?](Logging)

[What are all these classes?](Architecture)

[How can I use eye tracking](EyeTracking)

[Some possible solutions to problems can be found in the Trouble Shooting Section](TroubleShooting)

**Features provided are:**
* Quickly setup a study with factorial design
* Fading between levels/conditions
* HUD for easier controlling of the study
* store data in format ready-tu-use in statistics software
* Write out run data and last participant in json
* Start a map and be able to directly debug it
* Run on different systems: desktop, HMD, CAVE (nDisplay not tested yet!)
