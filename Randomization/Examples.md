Here some examples of randomized conditions and the ideas behind those can be found. **For simplicity, I left out ``USFMapFactors`` in all of them, which are however obviously required, just imagine all of the phases run on the same map.**
I also provide ``StudySetup.json`` declarations which can be extended and used for testing, e.g., in the [Study Framework Demo project](https://git-ce.rwth-aachen.de/vr-vis/VR-Group/unreal-development/demos/study-framework-demo).

# Fully Random
If you have two factors and want to fully randomize the order of presentation of their combinations for different participants. <br>
